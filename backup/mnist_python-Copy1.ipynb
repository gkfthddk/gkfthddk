    "# Handwritten Digit Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll give you a step by step walk-through of how to build a hand-written digit classifier using the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset. For someone new to deep learning, this exercise is arguably the \"Hello World\" equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model using the 60,000 training images and subsequently test its classification accuracy on the 10,000 test images.\n",

    "After running the above source code, the entire MNIST dataset should be fully loaded into memory. Note that for large datasets it is not feasible to pre-load the entire dataset first like we did here. What is needed is a mechanism by which we can quickly and efficiently stream data directly from the source. MXNet Data iterators come to the rescue here by providing exactly that. Data iterator is the mechanism by which we feed input data into an MXNet training algorithm and they are very simple to initialize and use and are optimized for speed. During training, we typically process training samples in small batches and over the entire training lifetime will end up processing each training example multiple times. In this tutorial, we'll configure the data iterator to feed examples in batches of 100. Keep in mind that each example is a 28x28 grayscale image and the corresponding label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image batches are commonly represented by a 4-D array with shape `(batch_size, num_channels, width, height)`. For the MNIST dataset, since the images are grayscale, there is only one color channel. Also, the images are 28x28 pixels, and so each image has width and height equal to 28. Therefore, the shape of input is `(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)`. Another important consideration is the order of input samples. When feeding training examples, it is critical that we don't feed samples with the same label in succession. Doing so can slow down training.\n",
    "Data iterators take care of this by randomly shuffling the inputs. Note that we only need to shuffle the training data. The order does not matter for test data.\n",
    "\n",

    "We will cover a couple of approaches for performing the hand written digit recognition task. The first approach makes use of a traditional deep neural network architecture called Multilayer Percepton (MLP). We'll discuss its drawbacks and use that as a motivation to introduce a second more advanced approach called Convolution Neural Network (CNN) that has proven to work very well for image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multilayer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach makes use of a [Multilayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) to solve this problem. We'll define the MLP using MXNet's symbolic interface. We begin by creating a place holder variable for the input data. When working with an MLP, we need to flatten our 28x28 images into a flat 1-D structure of 784 (28 * 28) raw pixel values. The order of pixel values in the flattened vector does not matter as long as we are being consistent about how we do this across all images."

    "If everything went well, we should see an accuracy value that is around 0.96, which means that we are able to accurately predict the digit in 96% of test images. This is a pretty good result. But as we will see in the next part of this tutorial, we can do a lot better than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we briefly touched on a drawback of MLP when we said we need to discard the input image's original shape and flatten it as a vector before we can feed it as input to the MLP's first fully connected layer. Turns out this is an important issue because we don't take advantage of the fact that pixels in the image have natural spatial correlation along the horizontal and vertical axes. A convolutional neural network (CNN) aims to address this problem by using a more structured weight representation. Instead of flattening the image and doing a simple matrix-matrix multiplication, it employs one or more convolutional layers that each performs a 2-D convolution on the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single convolution layer consists of one or more filters that each play the role of a feature detector. During training, a CNN learns appropriate representations (parameters) for these filters. Similar to MLP, the output from the convolutional layer is transformed by applying a non-linearity. Besides the convolutional layer, another key aspect of a CNN is the pooling layer. A pooling layer serves to make the CNN translation invariant: a digit remains the same even when it is shifted left/right/up/down by a few pixels. A pooling layer reduces a *n x m* patch into a single value to make the network less sensitive to the spatial location. Pooling layer is always included after each conv (+ activation) layer in the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following source code defines a convolutional neural network architecture called LeNet. LeNet is a popular network known to work well on digit classification tasks. We will use a slightly different version from the original LeNet implementation, replacing the sigmoid activations with tanh activations for the neurons"
